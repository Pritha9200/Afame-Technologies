This repository contains my Data Science internship project work. Here MOVIE RATING PREDICTION project I have done.
## Objective -
1.Building a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. Have
can use regression techniques to tackle this problem.
2.The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating
given to a movie by users or critics.
3.Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering,
and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors that influence movie
ratings and allows to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.
